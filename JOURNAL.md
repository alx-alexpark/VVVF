# May 24th: Did research on how exactly to build a VVVF inverter

This is project is something I've been working on ocasionally when I've had time during the school year, but I haven't done too much other than drawing out some simple schematics.

I looked for ways I could aquire the needed 3 phase motor for cheap. Thinking of perhaps buying a cheap washing machine off Facebook marketplace.

Also looked at gate drivers, thought that the TI UCC21520ADW would be a good gate driver IC due to its various protections and being a complete half-bridge driver. 

From this, I drew up a quick schematic using the above IC.
