# May 24th: Did research on how to build a VVVF inverter, and started with basic schematic

Recently, I stumbled upon a [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mjUHKlSBy4) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SfN0O-F9hM) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKpIqNNc9Kw) that made me really interested in the sounds that electric trains make. I discovered that many people made their own traction inverters to recreate these sounds, and I figured I wanted to try as well. Originally, I started this project a few months ago, but I hadn't made much progress.

I looked for ways I could aquire the needed 3 phase motor for cheap. Thinking of perhaps buying a cheap washing machine off Facebook marketplace.

Also looked at gate drivers, thought that the TI UCC21520ADW would be a good gate driver IC due to its various protections and being a complete half-bridge driver which makes it a lot simpler for me.

From this, I drew up a quick schematic using the above IC.
